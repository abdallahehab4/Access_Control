# Access_Control_Testing
 ## Test Role Definitions :
   ### summary:

#### *1: The Importance of Defining Roles in Modern Enterprises**
- In modern systems, roles are defined to manage user permissions and access to system resources.  
- **Two primary roles are typically expected:**
  1. **Administrators:**  
     - Have access to privileged, sensitive functionality and information.  
  2. **Regular Users:**  
     - Have access to standard business functionality and information for day-to-day activities.  

- Well-designed roles should align with the business processes supported by the system.



#### **2: Balancing Strictness and Flexibility in Access Management**
- **Strict Authorization:**  
  In traditional systems, access control relies heavily on rigid authorization policies.  
  However, strict control isn’t always the best solution, especially in trusted environments where confidentiality is not a priority.

- **Softer Controls:**  
  In less sensitive environments, alternatives can include:  
  - **Application Workflows:** Ensure correct task flows without enforcing strict restrictions.  
  - **Audit Logging:** Record activities to maintain data integrity without limiting user access unnecessarily.



#### **3: The Goldilocks Principle in Role Engineering**
- The Goldilocks principle emphasizes finding the right balance when defining roles in a system.  
- **Challenges of Unbalanced Roles:**
  1. **Too Few, Broad Roles:**  
     - Expose users to unnecessary functionalities, increasing security risks.  
  2. **Too Many, Tightly Tailored Roles:**  
     - Overcomplicate management and restrict user access to essential functionalities.

- The ideal solution is to strike a balance between generalized and specialized roles to meet business needs while maintaining security and simplicity.



### Key Takeaway:
Access management should strike a balance between rigid control and flexibility. Roles must align with business needs and avoid extremes, using softer controls like workflows and logging when appropriate.

##  Test objectives :
  Test Objectives:
Validate that the system roles are well-defined and properly separated to ensure:</br>
      - Each role has access only to relevant system functions and data.</br>
      - Roles effectively manage permissions, preventing unauthorized access.</br>
      - Business and system roles align with their intended responsibilities.</br>

##  Remediation
 Remediation of the issues can take the following forms:</br>
 • Role Engineering</br>
 • Mapping of business roles to system roles</br>
 • Separation of Duties</br>

 ## Test User Registration Process:
 ### Summary
 Automated or Semi-Automated Registration:

  - Some websites allow users to register and automatically (or partially) grant them system access.
  Identity Requirements:

- The level of identification needed depends on the system's security needs:
    - Positive Identification: Requires verified user details (e.g., email verification, ID).
    - No Identification: No validation required, typically for less sensitive systems.
      Public Applications:

  Often use fully automated registration due to the large user base, which makes manual management impractical.
- Corporate Applications:

  Prefer manual provisioning to ensure better control and security.
  This test case might not apply to such systems.

 ###  Test objectives
 - Verify that the identity requirements for user registration are 
aligned with business and security requirements.
 - Validate the registration process
 ###  How to test
 Verify that the identity requirements for user registration are aligned 
with business and security requirements:
 1. Can anyone register for access?
 2. Are registrations vetted by a human prior to provisioning, or are 
they automatically granted if the criteria are met?
 3. Can the same person or identity register multiple times?
 4. Can users register for different roles or permissions?
 5. What proof of identity is required for a registration to be success
ful?
 6. Are registered identities verified?
 Validate the registration process:
 - Can identity information be easily forged or faked?
 - Can the exchange of identity information be manipulated during 
registration?
 ###  Remediation :
 Implement identification and verification requirements that corre
spond to the security requirements of the information the credentials 
protect

## Test Account Provisioning Process :
### Summary
 The provisioning of accounts presents an opportunity for an attacker 
to create a valid account without application of the proper identifica
tion and authorization process.
### Test objectives
 Verify which accounts may provision other accounts and of what type.
 ### How to test : </br>
 Determine which roles are able to provision users and what sort of 
accounts they can provision.</br>
 • Is there any verification, vetting and authorization of provisioning 
requests?</br>
• Is there any verification, vetting and authorization of de-provisioning 
requests?</br>
 • Can an administrator provision other administrators or just users?</br>
 • Can an administrator or other user provision accounts with privileges 
greater than their own?</br>
 • Can an administrator or user de-provision themselves?</br>
 • How are the files or resources owned by the de-provisioned user 
managed? Are they deleted? Is access transferred?</br>
